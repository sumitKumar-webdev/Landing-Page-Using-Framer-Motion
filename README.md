# ðŸš— Friends Auto Electrical â€“ Animated Landing Page

This is a single-page animated website I built to **learn and practice Framer Motion** in a real-world scenario. The project is a fictional landing page for a Faridabad-based business called **Friends Auto Electrical**, inspired by their listing on IndiaMART.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

I created this project to:
- Learn **Framer Motion** for animation in React.
- Practice building responsive UI using **Tailwind CSS**.
- Explore clean UX patterns for mobile navigation and contact integration.
